# FAOLEX Food Legislation Analysis

Analysis of the FAOLEX (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Legislative database) food legislation dataset.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes global food legislation data from FAOLEX, containing over 40,000 records of food-related policies, regulations, and laws from countries worldwide.

## Current Status

✅ **Completed**:
- Loaded and cleaned the FAOLEX Food dataset (40,256 records)
- Implemented rule-based classification to categorize policies as **demand-side** or **supply-side**
- Generated `data/policy_categories.csv` with classification results
- Set up Python virtual environment with pandas

**Classification Results**:
- Supply-side policies: 27,049 (67.2%)
- Demand-side policies: 8,369 (20.8%)
- Unclear/ambiguous: 4,837 (12.0%)

## Setup

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the classification script:

```bash
python3 code/classify_policies.py
```

## Next Steps

Future analysis will explore:
- Temporal trends in food legislation
- Geographic distribution of policies
- Keyword and topic analysis
- Correlations between policy types and country characteristics
- [To be determined based on research objectives]

## About the Data

- Country/Territory
- Language (multilingual)
- Date of original text and amendments
